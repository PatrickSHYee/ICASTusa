            <p>ICAST has partnered with the Environmental Protection Agency to offer ENERGY STAR certification for green building upgrades and retrofits.
            </p>
            <p>The ENERGY STAR program was created in 1992 as part of the Clean Air Act mandate to "conduct a basic engineering research and technology program to develop, evaluate, and demonstrate non–regulatory strategies and technologies for reducing air pollution." Now ICAST has been recognized as a participant in this effort—and we want our customers and partners to be recognized, too!
            </p>
            <p>We will use the ENERGY STAR rating of 1-100 to rate your building’s energy efficiency. Simply <a href="@Url.Action("Contact", "Home")">contact us</a> to assess and rate your building.
            </p>
            <p>If you would like to learn more about the tremendous benefits of green energy upgrades so you can brand your building as ENERGY STAR-certified, visit our <a href="http://www.resourcesmart.org/">ResourceSmart</a> program for affordable upgrades.</p>

            <p>These certifications are graded by energy reduction level based on the green rehab project completed. These grades range from: Platinum 35% & Greater, Gold 26-35%, Silver 16-25%, Bronze 5-15% in energy reduction.
