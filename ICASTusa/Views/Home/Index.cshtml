    <h4>November Executive Night Speaker Series</h4>
    Oct 8, 2015<br />
    <strong>“The Next Stage of Impact Investing”</strong><br />
    <p>Over the past few years the concept of divestment has gained notable support from individuals, businesses, universities and institutional investors. The divestment process aims to make a statement with the absence of financial support to certain industries, but once divested, investors are faced with the question of where and how to re-invest responsibly. This Speaker Series will focus on the changing concept of impact investing, how its strategies are becoming more sophisticated, and how investing can provide social, environmental, and economic benefits, all at once. Join the discussion with our panel of senior level executives to explore the growing space of impact investment. <a href="~/Content/textFiles/Executive Night Speaker Series - Nov 2015(2).pdf" target="_blank">Click here</a> for more info and to RSVP </p>
